* Modulation Generator (MG1)
* Modulation Generator x8 (MG8)
* Modulation Generator x16 (MG16)
* Attenuator x8 (A8)
* Random Mute x8 (RM8)
* Random Stereo Mute x8 (RM8s)
* Simple Sine Oscillator (TT-SINE)
* Simple Sawtooth Oscillator (TT-SAW)
* Simple Square Oscillator (TT-SQR)
* Simple Triangle Oscillator (TT-TRI)
* Sine+ Oscillator (TT-SINE+)
* Sawtooth+ Oscillator (TT-SAW+)
* Square+ Oscillator (TT-SQR+)
* Triangle+ Oscillator (TT-TRI+)
* Random Mix x8 (RX8)
* Simplex Noise (SN1)
* Simplex Noise x8 (SN8)
* Simplex Oscillator (SN-OSC)
* Wavetable Oscillator (WAVE)

## Changelog
Version 1.4.1
* The changes in this release is based on [community feedback](https://community.vcvrack.com/t/tiny-tricks-request-for-feedback/6788). A huge thanks to all who pitched in!
* Added: Dark themes. Right click module to access them.
* Changed: Some design details in a bunch of modules.
* Changed: Simplex Oscillator (SN-OSC) now has a trigger input for the waveform mirroring.
* Changed: Wavetable Oscillator (WAVE) now has a trigger input for the waveform mirroring plus capturing (this is quite resource intensive).
* Changed: Added option to turn off scope in Wavetable Oscillator. Useful for improving the UI performance until scope code is improved.
* Changed: Very slight cosmetic request (#12).
* Fixed: Modulation Generators (MG1, MG8, MG16) now keeps values within 0-10 when set to UNI.
