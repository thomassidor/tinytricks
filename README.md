## Authors
@thomassidor - Project owner.

@baconpaul - Added polyphony to oscillator, logic and arithmetic modules.


## Color themes
Several color themes are included for each module:

* Light (Default)
* River Bed
* Oxford Blue
* Shark
* Cod Gray
* Firefly
* If you want a specific color theme included, let me know.

For all themes you can force the input ports to use a light theme, if you prefer the increased contrast. The option is available via right clicking the modules.

## Changelog

Version 1.5.0
* Added: [Random Wrangler (RW)](/docs/rw.md)
* Added: Polyphony to simple oscillators (SIN, SAW, SQR, TRI), plus oscillators (SIN+, SAW+, SQR+, TRI+), Simplex Oscillator (SN-OSC), Wavetable Oscillator (WAVE), TT-A and TT-L. Huge thanks to @baconpaul for contributing with this!
* Behind the scenes: Refactored WAVE for performance improvements.
* Behind the scenes: Improved screenshot generation

Version 1.4.2
* Added: Dark ports for dark themes.
* Added: Option to force light ports on dark themes.
* Added: Placeholder waveforms added to WAVE and SN-OSC for when displayed in module browser.
* Added: Help text to WAVE when no wavetable loaded or captured.
* Changed: License from MIT to GPLv3
* Fixed: Readjusted scope height in Simplex Oscillator.
* Behind the scenes: Added automatic screenshot generation.

Version 1.4.1
* The changes in this release is based on [community feedback](https://community.vcvrack.com/t/tiny-tricks-request-for-feedback/6788). A huge thanks to all who pitched in!
* Added: Dark themes. Right click module to access them.
* Changed: Some design details in a bunch of modules.
* Changed: Simplex Oscillator (SN-OSC) now has a trigger input for the waveform mirroring.
* Changed: Wavetable Oscillator (WAVE) now has a trigger input for the waveform mirroring plus capturing (this is quite resource intensive).
* Changed: Added option to turn off scope in Wavetable Oscillator. Useful for improving the UI performance until scope code is improved.
* Changed: Very slight cosmetic request (#12).
* Fixed: Modulation Generators (MG1, MG8, MG16) now keeps values within 0-10 when set to UNI.

Version 1.4.0
* Added: Wavetable Oscillator (WAVE)

Version 1.3.0
