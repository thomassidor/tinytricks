## Module descriptions (in progress)

### Sample and Hold x16 (SH16)
Generates 16 dfifferent random bipolar values upon trigger. Values are uniformly spread across the range.

### Attenuator x8 (A8)
Attenuates eight different signals the same amount.

### Wavetable Oscillator (WAVE)
A wavetable style oscillator - with three seperate oscillators - where you can (and need to) capture your own waves.

#### Creating the wavetable
To capture a wavetable connect audio to `WAVE TOP`, `MIDDLE` and `BOTTOM` and press `CAPTURE`. This will record the incoming audio to the respectively the top, middle and bottom positions in the wavetable. Intermediate values are automatically interpolated.

Connect `SYNC` from your oscillator to sync the recording to one single cycle. If not connected 2048 samples will be recorded.

`MIRROR` mirrors the recorded wave at the halfway point.

#### Main oscillator
`FREQ` and `FINE` determines the coarse and fine tuning of the output. CV for `FREQ` is 1 volt per octave.

`POS` determines the vertical position in the wavetable.

#### Oscillator 2 and Oscillator 3
These are seperate oscillators using the same wavetable that can be turned on and off individually using `ENABLE`.

`DETUNE` offsets the pitch reletive to the main oscillator.

`POS` offsets the vertical position in the wavetable relative to the main oscillator.

`SYNC` enables oscillator hard sync agains the chosen oscillator. To hear the effect detune the oscillator.


## Changelog
Version 1.4.2
* Added: Dark ports for dark themes.
* Added: Option to force light ports on dark themes.
* Added: Placeholder waveforms added to WAVE and SN-OSC for when displayed in module browser.
* Added: Help text to WAVE when no wavetable loaded or captured.
* Changed: License from MIT to GPLv3
* Fixed: Readjusted scope height in Simplex Oscillator.
* Behind the scenes: Added automatic screenshot generation.

Version 1.4.1
* The changes in this release is based on [community feedback](https://community.vcvrack.com/t/tiny-tricks-request-for-feedback/6788). A huge thanks to all who pitched in!
* Added: Dark themes. Right click module to access them.
* Changed: Some design details in a bunch of modules.
* Changed: Simplex Oscillator (SN-OSC) now has a trigger input for the waveform mirroring.
* Changed: Wavetable Oscillator (WAVE) now has a trigger input for the waveform mirroring plus capturing (this is quite resource intensive).
* Changed: Added option to turn off scope in Wavetable Oscillator. Useful for improving the UI performance until scope code is improved.
* Changed: Very slight cosmetic request (#12).
* Fixed: Modulation Generators (MG1, MG8, MG16) now keeps values within 0-10 when set to UNI.

Version 1.4.0
